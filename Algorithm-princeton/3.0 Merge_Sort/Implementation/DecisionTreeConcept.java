// Decision tree tells us:
//      Any compare-based sorting algorithm must use at least log(N!)~Nlog(N) compares in the worst case.
//      Assume array consists of N distinct values a1 through aN:
//            Worst case dictated by height h of decision tree
//            Binary tree of height h has at most 2^h leaves
//            N! different orderings == at least N! leaves
